## Translating strings

Matterpoll supports localization to various languages. We as maintainers rely on contributors to help with the translations.

Matterpoll uses [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) as library and tool to manage translation. The CLI tool `goi18n` is required to manage translation. You can install it by running `env GO111MODULE=off go get -u github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n/v2/goi18n`.

The localization process is defined below:
- During development, new translation strings may be added or existing ones updated.
- When a new version is planned to release soon, a repository maintainer opens an issue informing about this. The maintainer will ping all translation maintainer to inform them about this.
- Translation maintainers submit PRs with new translations, which may get reviewed by other translators.
- After all translation PRs are merged, the new version is released. If a translation PR is not submitted within a week, the release is cut without it.

### Translation Maintainers

- France: [@ldidry](https://github.com/ldidry)
- German: [@hanzei](https://github.com/hanzei)
- Japanese: [@kaakaa](https://github.com/kaakaa)
- Polish: [@burasuk](https://github.com/burasuk)
- Spanish: [@ernestoittig](https://github.com/ernestoittig)

### Translation Process for Existing Languages

1. Ensure all translation messages are correctly extracted:

`goi18n extract -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ server/`

2. Update your translation files:

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ assets/i18n/active.*.json`

3. Translate all messages in `asserts/i18n/translate.*.json` for the languages you are comfortable with.

4. Merge the translated messages into the active message files:

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ assets/i18n/active.*.json assets/i18n/translate.*.json`

5. Commit **only the language files you touched** and [submit a PR](https://github.com/matterpoll/matterpoll/compare).

### Translation Process for New Languages

Let's say you want to translate the local `de`. Replace `de` in the following commands with the local you want to translate. See [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/tree/master/i18n) for the list of possible locals.

1. Create a translation file:

`touch asserts/i18n/translate.de.json`

2. Merge all current messages into your translation file:

`goi18n merge -format json -outdir assets/i18n/ assets/i18n/active.en.json assets/i18n/translate.de.json`

3. Translate all messages in `asserts/i18n/translate.de.json` and rename it to `active.de.json`.

4. Add your language to the list of [Supported Languages](https://github.com/matterpoll/matterpoll#localization) in `README.md` and add you to the list of [Translation Maintainer](#translation-maintainers) in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

5. [Submit a PR](https://github.com/matterpoll/matterpoll/compare) with these files,
